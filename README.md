# Minicom Next

## About
We're going to give you a hands-on coding exercise called Minicom. This repository contains a Next.js application that provides a customer support chat interface. Think of it as a lightweight replacement to the Intercom Messenger. It has some basic email authentication for users and allows them to have support conversations that are stored on an Intercom instance and accessed through Intercom's REST API.

This session is “open-book”. Use any resources online that you need (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, Google, Stack Overflow, framework documentation).

## The mission
Wire up this application to your Intercom instance. Make it so that conversations can be had from it. This means, you can send and receive messages.

Some follow up ideas:
- Can you enable multiple conversations?
- Can you make it work for different users?
- Whatever else _you_ can think of!

## The interview
**Setup** (15 mins)
To begin the session you’ll be joined by an engineer who’ll make sure you’re all set up and ready to go with the exercise.

**Get started on the Minicom task** (45 mins)
The first 45 minutes are for you. Get stuck in without any distractions. Explore the codebase, get started with the objective. Feel free to use any resource that would help you… ChatGPT/Claude, Google, StackOverflow, etc…. It is all encouraged and expected.

**Pairing session** (45 mins)
Buddy up with one of our product engineers on your Minicom task. Their aim is to get a feel for working beside you. They'll try to help you along and give advice. They'll never try to trick you or catch you out, but sometimes you might disagree with their suggestions. It's fine to respectfully challenge or ask why, and look up information online.

**Wrap Up** (15 mins)
Talk about what you have built and exchange ideas of what you could possibly do in the future.

## Getting Started
0. **Pre-requisites**:
   - A Node.js version greater than 18.17.0 and the `npm` command line interface. You can check for both with the following commands:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   If you don't have them already installed, we suggest following [these steps](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.
